1. Summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setting up automation scripts and a folder structure for a production-ready project can be a tedious and error-prone process. This project is a template project that has all of DevOps practices that can be reused across similar projects. By doing this, we can minimize overhead efforts and devote more time to developing business logic.

`cookiecutter <https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter>`_ is a tool that can generate a codebase folder structure from a template project. The tool leverages the `Jinja template language <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/>`_ to perform advanced string replacements in text content, as well as in file and folder names. Developers can use this tool to convert their projects into templates for future use. Below is the automation process to generate a code skeleton for AWS + Lambda + Python styled project::

    package_name [my_package]: aws_lambda_python_project
    author_name [Firstname Lastname]: Firstname Lastname
    author_email [firstname.lastname@email.com]: firstlast@email.com
    semantic_version [0.1.1]: 0.1.1
    aws_profile [my_aws_profile]: my_aws_profile
    aws_account_id [111122223333]: 123456789012
    aws_region [us-east-1]: us-east-1

Converting a concrete project into a template project can also be a tedious and error-prone process. To simplify this process, I created a tool `cookiecutter_maker <https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/cookiecutter_maker-project>`_, a Python tool that is the inverse of ``cookiecutter`` and can speed up the process of creating templates.


2. Concept
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- System Python: the Python used by your OS. a lot of OS internal software depends on this, don't touch it anytime!
- User Python: additional Python installed by user that can be used as the base Python interpreter for virtuale environment. I usually use `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ to install and manage multiple Python versions.
- Virtualenv Python: `the virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ that purposely created for your project, it is isolated from the User Python and System Python.


3. Generate Project Folder Structure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have to install the tool `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html>`_ to generate the folder structure from the template project. You should install this tool to your "User Python".

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3.8 install cookiecutter

Then `follow the instruction <https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/cookiecutter-aws-lambda-python-project>`_ to create a new project from the template. You will be prompted to enter a bunch of project config values. (These are defined in the projectâ€™s ``cookiecutter.json``.) In this tutorial, we created a git repo called ``dataops_example-project``, and the python library name is ``dataops_example``.

.. code-block:: bash

    # use specific version
    cookiecutter https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/cookiecutter-aws-lambda-python-project --checkout tags/${version}

    # for example (v5 is the latest as of 2023-02-18)
    cookiecutter https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/cookiecutter-aws-lambda-python-project --checkout tags/v5

Now you have a folder structure on your local laptop.


4. Initialize your Git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now we want to check in the code skeleton to your Git repository. You can use any Git vendor you like (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, AWS CodeCommit, etc.). In this tutorial, I will use the AWS CodeCommit.

1. Go to `AWS CodeCommit Console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/repositories>`_ to create a repo called ``dataops_example-project``.
2. Follow `this AWS Document <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-git-remote-codecommit.html>`_ to clone the repo using ``git-remote-codecommit`` (GRC). If you have GRC CLI installed and the default aws CLI is the one with the AWS Account you are working on, then you can just run the following command to clone the repo:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/dataops_example-project

.. image:: ./images/clone-repo.png

3. Copy the code skeleton to the repo folder and commit the code skeleton to the repo. You can use either the `git CLI <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line>`_ or any Git Client or GUI. I personally use the `GitHub desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_.

4. Refresh the AWS CodeCommit Console, you should see the code skeleton in the repo.
